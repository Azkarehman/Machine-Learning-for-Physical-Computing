### Week 3 Run a model with Tensorflow Lite / Tensorflow.js / ml5.js
#### Notes:
- Understand the concept of a “machine learning model.”
- What is a “pre-trained model”?
- What does it mean to discuss the “architecture” of a machine learning model?
- Define and diagram an artificial neural network.

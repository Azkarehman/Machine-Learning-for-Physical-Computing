# Exercise 7: Gesture Controlled USB Emoji Keyboard

The Emoji_Button example, __ArduinoSketchs/Emoji_Button/Emoji_Button.ino__, shows how to create a USB keyboard that prints and emoji character. (This only works on Linux and macos, so if you're running Windows, find a friend to work on this exercise.)

Try combining the Emoji_Button example with the IMU_Classifier sketch to create an gesture controlled emoji keyboard. ðŸ‘Š
